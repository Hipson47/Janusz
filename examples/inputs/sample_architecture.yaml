    ## Overview


    This document describes a sample microservices architecture for an e-commerce
    platform. The system handles user authentication, product catalog management,
    order processing, and payment integration.


    ## System Components


    ### Authentication Service


    The authentication service handles user registration, login, and session management.


    **Key Features:**

    - JWT token-based authentication

    - Password hashing with bcrypt

    - Session management with Redis

    - OAuth2 integration for social login


    **Best Practices:**

    - Always validate JWT tokens on each request

    - Use secure password policies (minimum 12 characters)

    - Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints

    - Store only hashed passwords in the database


    ### Product Catalog Service


    Manages product information, categories, and inventory.


    **Implementation Details:**

    - RESTful API with JSON responses

    - PostgreSQL database with proper indexing

    - Elasticsearch for product search

    - Image storage on AWS S3


    ### Order Processing Service


    Handles order creation, payment processing, and fulfillment.


    **Business Rules:**

    - Orders must have valid payment information

    - Inventory must be reserved before payment

    - Failed payments should trigger order cancellation

    - Email notifications for order status changes


    ## Deployment Strategy


    ### Containerization


    All services are containerized using Docker with multi-stage builds for optimal
    image sizes.


    ### Orchestration


    Kubernetes is used for container orchestration with the following components:

    - Ingress controller for API gateway

    - Service mesh with Istio

    - Horizontal Pod Autoscaling

    - ConfigMaps and Secrets for configuration management


    ### Monitoring


    - Prometheus for metrics collection

    - Grafana for dashboards

    - ELK stack for log aggregation

    - AlertManager for incident response


    ## Security Considerations


    ### Data Protection


    - All data in transit is encrypted with TLS 1.3

    - Sensitive data at rest is encrypted with AES-256

    - Database backups are encrypted and stored off-site


    ### Access Control


    - Role-based access control (RBAC) for all services

    - Principle of least privilege applied

    - Regular access reviews and audit logging


    ## Performance Requirements


    - API response time < 200ms for 95th percentile

    - System must handle 1000 concurrent users

    - Database queries < 50ms average response time

    - 99.9% uptime SLA


    ## Future Enhancements


    - GraphQL API for flexible queries

    - Event sourcing for better audit trails

    - Machine learning for product recommendations

    - Multi-region deployment for global scalability
