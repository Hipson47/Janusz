API Specification v1.0

OVERVIEW
This specification defines the REST API for the user management system.

ENDPOINTS

GET /users
Returns a list of all users in the system.
Query parameters:
- limit: Maximum number of users to return (default: 50)
- offset: Number of users to skip (default: 0)

Response format:
{
  "users": [
    {
      "id": "string",
      "email": "string",
      "name": "string",
      "created_at": "datetime"
    }
  ],
  "total": 100,
  "limit": 50,
  "offset": 0
}

POST /users
Creates a new user account.
Request body must include:
- email: Valid email address (required)
- password: Minimum 8 characters (required)
- name: User's full name (optional)

Best Practice: Validate email format and password strength server-side.

Response: Returns the created user object with generated ID.

Error responses:
- 400 Bad Request: Invalid input data
- 409 Conflict: Email already exists
- 500 Internal Server Error: Database connection failed

DELETE /users/{id}
Removes a user account permanently.
Only administrators can delete user accounts.

Security Note: Implement proper authorization checks.

AUTHENTICATION
All API requests require authentication via JWT tokens.
Include the token in the Authorization header:
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>

ERROR HANDLING
All errors return JSON with the following structure:
{
  "error": {
    "code": "string",
    "message": "string",
    "details": {}
  }
}

LOGGING
All API requests and responses are logged for audit purposes.
Sensitive data (passwords, tokens) are never logged.

RATE LIMITING
API calls are limited to 1000 requests per hour per IP address.
Exceeded limits return HTTP 429 Too Many Requests.
